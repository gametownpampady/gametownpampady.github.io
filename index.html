          <h2>Welcome to Galore, the Wolf Game social network.
            This is my tribute to The Shepherd, our Watchful Guardian. For I have been a fanboy since the genesis Wolf
            Game whitepaper.</h2>

          <p>Galore is a $WOOL burning social experiment on the new internet exclusively for Wolf Game ERC-721 tokens.
            Here we role play, flaunt wolfpacks, and create lore around our mythical Wolf Game characters.
            A place to taunt and bond, to build and guild, all for that Woolish High.</p>
          <p>
            Fellow High Stakers, the time has come for me to initiate Title Galore.
            This will be your first act on Galore by which each of you will claim your unique Title of High Staker. Some
            call it the username which I got to admit is not wrong.
            Only after securing your Title, would you be able to enter our Woolish Internet Society
          </p>

          <p>This homage to the Protector of Our Lands will be incomplete without his favorite ritual, the $WOOL BURN.
            To claim the Title each of you will be required to sacrifice a specific amount of $WOOL to His favorite
            machine, The Burner: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD. For there is no greater act of loyalty on
            Galore than the BURN.
            This serves both as a token of your commitment to the great game and adds as a verification mechanism for
            the assets you claim to own.</p>

          <p>Alpha Game had us divided. Maybe a little too much. And this is my way of saying that we are all in this
            together as Shepherd's beloved children. That even though we have our differences, we are all here to serve
            the precious $WOOL and carry it onto its glorious destiny.</p>

          <p>Get your Titles, plug into the mind of your most precious Wolf Game asset, and come vibe.
            For on Galore itâ€™s All Vibes No Facts and High Stakes nonetheless.</p>

          <p><span>- The Burner Sheep</span></p>
          <br>
          <p>Note:<br>
            Galore is being built and will launch on <span>4/20/2022.</span>
          </p>
          <p>But you can start claiming your titles starting today.
            Direct message <a href="#">@WolfGameLore</a> on Twitter to get sign up instructions and help me out Alpha-Testing feature-sets. The earlier you get here, the better perks you get to enjoy.</p>

            <p>
              Galore(v1) will be built utilizing Twitter hashtags and public information available on Ethereum Mainnet. 
              You do not have to connect your wallets here. I will win your trust before making you do that.
              But you will need a Twitter account to partake and of course, you need to be an active Alpha Game player.</p>
